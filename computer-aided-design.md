I started an object similar to the polygon using OnShape. It was just my first 3D model. \(gif below\)

I found this example of polyhedrons that can be a start point [here](http://www.korthalsaltes.com). I chosed this [icosidodecahedron](http://www.korthalsaltes.com/model.php?name_en=icosidodecahedron), downloaded and printed the file, just to taste the geometry.
