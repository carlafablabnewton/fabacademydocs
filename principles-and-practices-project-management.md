I used to build websites with no-coding platforms, like Wordpress and WebFlow. But for Fab Academy i challenged myself learning a few lessons about HTML, CSS and GitHub. It was much more difficult for me than expected.

Fortunately, i found GitBook on XXX's Fab Academy documentation, and i believe this is the simpliest way for documentating my progress online. I started to use Git Book for my Fab Labs documentation as well.

# **Final Project**\_**NOMAD**

NOMAD is an eco-friendly shelter, designed for people in movement. It can be used as temporary house for refugees, homeless people, nomads and travellers. I want to creat a parametric design that can be scaled and erected in several different sizes, with flexible folders and envelopes. The final design must enable some basic house structure such as water, eletricity and internet access. The project must be easy to reproduce, using CNC or lasercut machine if possible, or even handcrafted in places without Fab Labs. My design references are indian Architecture from Amazon Forest, temporary architecture, design oriented by origami theory, Marcelo Rosenbaum's eco-friendly projects
