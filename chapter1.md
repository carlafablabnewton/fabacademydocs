# About me

 I am fab manager at Fab Lab Newton \(www.fablabnewton.com.br\), in Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais. I always worked at creative fields such as advertising art direction, graphic design and illustration. I am also co-founder of two maker communities in my city: BH Arduiners Meetup and Movimento Maker Minas.

I see design as the ‘engineering’ of aesthetics, with the scope not only to beautiful solutions, but truly fill gaps in our daily lives. My methodology includes deep research of the ‘bigger picture’ of the project and its market, identifying possible points of innovation at every stage of the process. As designer, manufacturing and digital fabrication are essencial skills in the creative process and project development.
