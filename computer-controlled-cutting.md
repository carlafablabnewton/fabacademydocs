#### Triangular Shelf {#have-you}

I love triangles, and i needed to create a shelf to storage the Fab Lab manuals. I found this reference [here](http://shoeboxdwelling.com/2011/07/18/triangular-shelf/) and started to design my own parametric shelf. I wanted a clean design, with just a few pieces.

I used Inkscape to design, using the Clone tool to create the parametric parts. Inkscape is an easy software but is new for me, so a shelf with simple geometric designs took too long to be finished.

I choosed mdf 3mm for prototyping. After 6 designs i got the final solution. The most difficult part for me was design the joints, and to understand how a parametric design works. Using the lasercutter machine it was the easiest part.

And finally we have a shelf :\)

#### Customizing my laptop with vinyl cutter {#have-you}

Following my passion for geometry forms, i draw some forms for testing the vynil cutter. I choosed from straight to curve designs, from small to big forms, a sequence of circular thin lines, a bold \(and weird\) form with curves and straight parts. It's not figurative, just a lot of designs to know how the vinyl cut machine works. I also put 2 different colors. The software used was Adobe Illustrator CS6.

Files ready to print, the challenge was how to change vinyl cut colors.

Files ready to cut, the next challenge was change the vynil colors.
