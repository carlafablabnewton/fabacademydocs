#### Triangular Shelf {#have-you}

I love triangles, and i needed to create a shelf to storage the Fab Lab manuals. I found this reference [here](http://shoeboxdwelling.com/2011/07/18/triangular-shelf/) and started to design my own parametric shelf. I wanted a clean design, with just a few pieces.

I used Inkscape to design, using the Clone tool to create the parametric parts. Inkscape is an easy software but is new for me, so a shelf with simple geometric designs took too long to be finished. 

I choosed mdf 3mm for prototyping. After 6 designs i got the final solution. The most difficult part for me was design the joints, and to understand how a parametric design works. Using the lasercutter machine it was the easiest part.
